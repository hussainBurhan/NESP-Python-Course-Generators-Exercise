# Generator vs List Size Comparison
This Python program demonstrates the memory efficiency of using generators compared to lists. 
It defines a generator function my_gen that yields numbers up to a specified limit. The program then creates a generator object and a list, and measures their respective memory usage.

## Usage:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file (generator_vs_list.py).
4. Run the program using a Python interpreter:

## Example Output

`My_range is returning: 0
0
My_range is returning: 1
1
My_range is returning: 2
2
This generator takes 112 bytes
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
My_range is returning: 0
My_range is returning: 1
My_range is returning: 2
My_range is returning: 3
My_range is returning: 4
My_range is returning: 5
My_range is returning: 6
My_range is returning: 7
My_range is returning: 8
My_range is returning: 9
This normal list takes 200 bytes`
