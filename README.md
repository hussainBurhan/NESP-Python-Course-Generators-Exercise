# Generator vs List Size Comparison
This Python program demonstrates the memory efficiency of using generators compared to lists. 
It defines a generator function my_gen that yields numbers up to a specified limit. The program then creates a generator object and a list, and measures their respective memory usage.

## Usage:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file (generator_vs_list.py).
4. Run the program using a Python interpreter:

## Acknowledgments
This program was created as part of the Python for Everyone course offered by the National Emerging Skills Program (NESP).
